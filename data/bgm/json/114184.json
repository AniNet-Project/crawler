        "info": "Korra couldn't have less in common with Aang, the previous Avatar. A 17-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe, she is as hot-headed and eager as she is talented. When she runs away to Republic City, her stubbornness and impatience get in the way of her bending studies, but it is clear from the start that she is destined for greatness. Korra discovers many new things in Republic City - some amazing and some terrifying. Whether its honing her bending skills in the Pro-bending Arena, facing off with street thugs or facing an anti-bending rebellion, Korra learns that being the Avatar comes with many dangers and responsibilities. As if being a teenager wasn't hard enough on its own!",

Mako's younger brother and Pro-bending teammate, Bolin tends to be more laidback and likes to have a good time. Despite their tough childhood, Bolin always has a smile on his face and a lady on his arm. In fact, it was Bolin who was responsible for introducing Mako to Korra. But Bolin is no clown. When the time comes to buckle down and bend some earth, this tough contender can handle his business.",

Two weeks after Harmonic Convergence, she joined her friends in the search for the new airbenders. However, their search stopped when the Red Lotus attempted to kidnap Avatar Korra in Zaofu and they worked to bring the organization down instead. Three years later, in 174 AG, Asami assisted in defeating Kuvira and began a romantic relationship with her best friend, Korra.",
